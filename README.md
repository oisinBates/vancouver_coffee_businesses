# Overview
Analyzing and visualizing Vancouver's chain coffee stores via the [City of Vancouver Open Data API](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/) and the [VancouvR](https://github.com/mountainMath/VancouvR) package.

All content is generated from the scripts in the `source` folder, while the output of these scripts (images, html, and csv files) is written to the `output` folder.

In order to run, download an API Key from [opendata.vancouver.ca](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/help/) and create a `.Renviron` file in your root directory with `vancouver_open_data_api_key=your-new-api-key`.
For all other guidance and troubleshooting, refer to the _Vancouver Open Data_ and _VancouvR_ documentation that is linked above.
